# Multi State continuous-time movement modeling

This R package implements an MCMC algorithm for inference into state-switching continuous-time movement models, based on the R packages MScrawl (Michelot and Blackwell, 2019) and ctmm (Calabrese et al., 2016).

The package currenty only implements the iostropic OUF model with shared parameters for multiple individuals.
